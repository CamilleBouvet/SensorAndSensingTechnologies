When using the linearisation of the curve using the whole excel table (y=0.1632*x-50.514)
the result when testing the sensor give 38°C for a value of ADC = 544.

The error here is 
E1 = 38 - 28,27463787
E1 = 9.72536213

When using the linearisation including only the value of ADC from 10 to 900(y=0.1236*x-34.064)
the result when testing the sensor give 32°C for ADC = 538

The error here is
E2 = 32 - 27,65398688
E2 = 4.34601312

So to use this sensor in a more effective way it's better not to take in account the values
at the very begining and the very and of its measure range.
